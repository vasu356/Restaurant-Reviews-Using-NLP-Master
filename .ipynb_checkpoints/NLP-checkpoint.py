# Creating the Bag of Words Model
# Bag of Words Model is a sparse matrix where each row is the review and each column is a unique 
# word from the reviews.
# Tokenization - process of taking all unique words of reviews and creating columns for each word.
# Since this a problem of classification we have dependent and independent variables and each 
# unique word/column is like an independent variable and the review(good/bad) depends on these words.
